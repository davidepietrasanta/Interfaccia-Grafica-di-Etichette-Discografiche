The project must be written using Qt library.

The project requires the creation of a graphical interface for viewing
of the artists of two of the most prestigious world record labels. Specifically, it is required that:
1. The files relating to the two labels are automatically downloaded through the following links:
- Universal (http://www.ivl.disco.unimib.it/minisites/cpp/List_of_Universal_artists.txt);
- EMI (http://www.ivl.disco.unimib.it/minisites/cpp/List_of_EMI_artists.txt);
2. The two lists are automatically created and have to display
the artists of each label;
3. For each artist there is a hyperlink to his Wikipedia page.
4. Two graphs are created, one for each label, reporting the
number of artists for each letter;
5. A graph is displayed showing the number of artists for
each label.

Note 1: Use version 5.11 or higher of the Qt library.

Note 2: Make the content of the adaptive application window size.
